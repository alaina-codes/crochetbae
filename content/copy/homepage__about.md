I got into the wide world of crocheting from my job as a software engineer (i.e. __professional nerd__). My leader is an very talented crocheter and told me about this crochet kit that she recently purchased: [Crochet Characters Soft & Snuggly Cacti: 12 Succulent Designs](https://www.amazon.com/Crochet-Characters-Soft-Snuggly-Cacti/dp/0760355215/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=crochet+succulents&qid=1560735801&s=gateway&sr=8-3). Crocheted. Succulents. **I was sold!**

I purchased one for myself and off I was on a rabbit hole of crocheting anything and everything I could possibly think of. As a software engineer, I knew I wanted to build a website to blog about crocheting, share my patterns, and even share my life of occassion.
